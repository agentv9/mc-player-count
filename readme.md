### MC player count

## To use:

1. Download and doubleclick `setup.bat` to install the dependencies
2. Doubleclick `run.bat` to start the program
3. Enter your servers IP and Port
4. just wait, every 30 seconds it will log all online players to the console

Alternatively if you dont want to enter the IP and Port everytime you launch you can just make a `config,json` file in the same directory setup like this:
```
{
    "ip": "youriphere",
    "port": "your server port here"
}
```
then it will stop asking for the ip and port and will always use the stuff specified in the config file.




## Description: 

just a simple terminal program i made when i was bored during school, it logs all online players on a server so ig its useful if you wana track someones playtime without being on the server yourself.
